# Caching in Python

## Overview

This repository contains examples and explanations of various caching techniques in Python. Caching is a method to store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area to improve performance and reduce the time required to retrieve data.

## Introduction

Caching is a crucial optimization technique used to enhance the performance of applications by storing copies of frequently accessed data. This reduces the need to recompute or fetch data from slower storage layers.

## Types of Caching

### In-Memory Caching

In-memory caching stores data in the system's RAM, providing the fastest access times. It is suitable for small to medium-sized datasets.

### Disk Caching

Disk caching involves storing data on a local disk. It is slower than in-memory caching but can handle larger datasets.

### Distributed Caching

Distributed caching uses a network of multiple servers to store cached data. It is scalable and suitable for large-scale applications.

## Popular Caching Libraries

### functools.lru_cache

The `functools.lru_cache` decorator in Python provides a simple way to cache function results using an LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy.

### cachetools

`cachetools` is a Python library that provides various caching strategies and data structures, including LRU, LFU (Least Frequently Used), and TTL (Time-To-Live) caches.

### redis-py

`redis-py` is a Python client for Redis, a powerful in-memory data structure store that can be used as a distributed cache.

## Examples

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def expensive_function(param):
        # Simulate an expensive computation
        return param * 2
```

## Conclusion

Caching is an effective technique to improve the performance of Python applications. By understanding and implementing different caching strategies, developers can significantly reduce latency and enhance user experience.
